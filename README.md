# 🏥 Health Prediction Application

## 📌 Project Overview

The Health Prediction Application is an AI-powered healthcare solution developed using Python, Streamlit, SQLite, and Machine Learning.

The application enables users to manage patient records and predict potential health risks using blood test parameters such as Glucose, Haemoglobin, and Cholesterol. The predicted health condition is automatically generated and stored in the Remarks field.

This project demonstrates CRUD operations, data validation, database management, machine learning integration, and user-friendly application development.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Store and manage patient health records.
* Validate patient information before processing.
* Predict possible health risks using machine learning.
* Provide a simple and interactive user interface.
* Demonstrate AI/ML integration within a healthcare application.

## ✨ Features

### Patient Management

* Add new patient records
* View all patient records
* Update existing patient records
* Delete patient records

### Data Validation

* Email format validation
* Numeric validation for blood test values
* Date of Birth validation

### AI-Based Health Prediction

The application predicts possible health conditions based on:

* Glucose Level
* Haemoglobin Level
* Cholesterol Level

Prediction categories:

* Healthy
* Diabetes Risk
* Heart Disease Risk

### Database Storage

* SQLite database for persistent storage
* Secure storage of patient information and prediction results
